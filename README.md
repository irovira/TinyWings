Introduction
======================

Over the course of the semester, we have been able to explore a variety of procedural techniques for generating computer graphics. For our final project, we wanted to apply the techniques we learned towards making a cohesive, engaging, and interactive experience. What better way to do that than a game?

We want to explore 2D graphics by recreating Tiny Wings for WebGL. We will be implementing all core elements of the gameplay along with the procedural techniques for level generation.
